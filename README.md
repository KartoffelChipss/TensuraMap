### Where does the data come from?

The data mainly comes from the [Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken Wiki](https://tensura.fandom.com/wiki/Home).

If there are any mistakes or missing countries, please refer to the [How can I contribute or correct mistakes?](#how-can-i-contribute-or-correct-mistakes) section.

### How does it work?

I layed out the map using summerstyles's [html image map creator](https://summerstyle.github.io/summer/). I then took the coordinates and created svg polygons for each country with these coordinates. I used an svg rather than image map because it is more flexible and easier to style.

### How is it hosted?

I am using GitHub Pages to host this project. You can view the map [here](https://tensura.j4n.net).

### How can I contribute or correct mistakes?

You can create an issue or a pull request on this repository. I will review it as soon as possible. You can also contact me on my [Discord](https://strassburger.org/discord).
